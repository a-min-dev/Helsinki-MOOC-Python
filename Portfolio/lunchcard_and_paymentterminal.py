"""
The program includes a class called LunchCard and a class called PaymentTerminal, 
which models students at a university using a cafeteria meal card and/or cash as payment
methods.

The constructor for the LunchCard class takes the initial balance available on the 
meal card as its argument.  

The LunchCard class definition includes methods to subtract
from the balance when eating a meal or adding to the balance when depositing money.
These methods are used with methods in the PaymentTerminal class.

In the PaymentTerminal class, the funds available in the terminal is increased when
a student makes a valid cash payment.  The amount of meals sold is increased whether
a student pays by cash or with a lunchcard.
