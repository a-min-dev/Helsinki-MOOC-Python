# Helsinki MOOC Python Programming - AI Journey
## University of Helsinki 2026

This respository contains my progress through the University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC

## Featured Portfolio
*These selections demonstrate specific logical milestones:*

* **[gift_tax_calculator.py](./Portfolio/gift_tax_calculator.py)** - Tiered tax bracket logic and formatted rounding 
* **[next_leap_year.py](./Portfolio/next_leap_year.py)** - While loop testing Boolean conditions with nested conditionals
* **[data_processor.py](./Portfolio/data_processor.py)** - Use of while loop to
take and convert user input to data with error prevention
* **[ui_frame_generator.py](./Portfolio/ui_frame_generator.py)** - Creates a frame
around a user-inputted string printed
in the center of the frame
* **[substring_extractor.py](./Portfolio/substring_extractor.py)** - Finds all substrings of length 3 that start with a
user-provided character in a user-provided word
* **[find_second_occurrence.py](./Portfolio/find_second_occurrence.py)** - Finds the second occurrence of a
user-provided substring in a user-provided word and outputs
the index of the start of the second substring
* **[chessboard.py](./Portfolio/chessboard.py)** - The chessboard function
prints out alternating rows of 0s and 1s
* **[spruce_tree.py](./Portfolio/spruce_tree.py)** - The program uses two functions, line and spruce, to output a centered
spruce tree diagram
* **[longest_words_in_list.py](./Portfolio/longest_words_in_list.py)** - The program uses a function, all_the_longest,
to return a new list of the all the longest strings in the original list
* **[most_common_character.py](./Portfolio/most_common_character.py)** - The program finds the most
commonly occuring letter in a string.  In the case of a tie,
the character that appears earliest in the string breaks
the tie as the most common character
* **[classroom_grade_statistics.py](./Portfolio/classroom_grade_statistics.py)** - The program outputs
the grade statistics for a classroom, including the classroom average, the percentage of students who
pass the course, and a histogram of student grades.  The program uses multiple functions to help
calculate the necessary statistics
* **[sudoku_grid.py](./Portfolio/sudoku_grid.py)** - The program checks the validity of a sudoku grid, in which the
numbers 1-9 should appear at most once in each row, column,
and 3x3 block within the 9x9 sudoku grid
* **[phone_book.py](./Portfolio/phone_book.py)** - The program prompts the user to select from 3 options:  to search
for a phone number in a phone directory, to add a name and phone number in the phone directory, or quit the program.
The phone directory uses a dictionary with keys representing names and values representing associated phone numbers.
A person is allowed to have multiple phone numbers
* **[student_database.py](./Portfolio/student_database.py)** - The program creates a student base,
which currently stores a student's name and the student's corresponding completed courses and best
grades received in the course.  The summary function prints out statistics which includes which
students has completed the most courses and which student has the best GPA
