# Helsinki MOOC Python Programming - AI Journey
## University of Helsinki 2026

This respository contains my progress through the University of Helsinki's Python Programming MOOC

## Featured Portfolio
*These selections demonstrate specific logical milestones:*

* **[gift_tax_calculator.py](./Portfolio/gift_tax_calculator.py)** - Tiered tax bracket logic and formatted rounding 
* **[next_leap_year.py](./Portfolio/next_leap_year.py)** - While loop testing Boolean conditions with nested conditionals
* **[data_processor.py](./Portfolio/data_processor.py)** - Use of while loop to
take and convert user input to data with error prevention
* **[ui_frame_generator.py](./Portfolio/ui_frame_generator.py)** - Creates a frame
around a user-inputted string printed
in the center of the frame
* **[substring_extractor.py](./Portfolio/substring_extractor.py)** - Finds all substrings of length 3 that start with a
user-provided character in a user-provided word
* **[find_second_occurrence.py](./Portfolio/find_second_occurrence.py)** - Finds the second occurrence of a
user-provided substring in a user-provided word and outputs
the index of the start of the second substring
* **[chessboard.py](./Portfolio/chessboard.py)** - The chessboard function
prints out alternating rows of 0s and 1s
* **[spruce_tree.py](./Portfolio/spruce_tree.py)** - The program uses two functions, line and spruce, to output a centered
spruce tree diagram
* **[longest_words_in_list.py](./Portfolio/longest_words_in_list.py)** - The program uses a function, all_the_longest,
to return a new list of the all the longest strings in the original list
* **[most_common_character.py](./Portfolio/most_common_character.py)** - The program finds the most
commonly occuring letter in a string.  In the case of a tie,
the character that appears earliest in the string breaks
the tie as the most common character
* **[classroom_grade_statistics.py](./Portfolio/classroom_grade_statistics.py)** - The program outputs
the grade statistics for a classroom, including the classroom average, the percentage of students who
pass the course, and a histogram of student grades.  The program uses multiple functions to help
calculate the necessary statistics
